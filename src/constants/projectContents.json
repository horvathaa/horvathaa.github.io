            "description": "The subject of my dissertation work is an empirical investigation into what information developers naturally keep track of and tooling solutions to make capturing and sharing this information easier. I have developed a suite of annotation tools that support capturing developer information in-context. This suite includes Adamite, a Chrome extension for annotating developers' online learning materials, and Catseye, a Visual Studio Code extension, which allows developers to keep track of their open development tasks, questions, and more through code annotations.",

Much of this work was done with my peers at Oregon State University, where we developed GenderMag, a methodology to uncover cognitive biases in technology. I have also looked at open source and closed source datasets to understand whether work is completed equitably by subpopulations of developers.",
